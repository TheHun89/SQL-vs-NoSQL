# SQL vs NoSQL

RDBMS

* Inner Joins: 

1. Full - all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records
2. Inner - records that have matching values in both tables
3. Left - all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
4. Right - all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table


NoSQL - built to scale with high performance but queries are less flexible; structure relies on key/value store; structure can be tables, documents, graphs or json; scales very well
